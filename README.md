**Things to accomplish**

1. Use A regulator to power the MSP430.
2. How to use hardware to achieve robot control.
2. Which pins will output which signals you need.
3. Which side of the motor will you attach these signals to.
4. How to use these signals to achieve forward/back/left/right movement.
5. consider how you will setup the PWM subsystem to achieve control.
6. what are the registers you'll need to use.
7. which bits in the registers are important?
8. what's the initialization sequence you'll need?
9. Consider additional hardware you'll need (regulator, motor driver chip, decoupling capacitor).
10. How will you connect these extra parts?
11. Try to build simple commands, such as moving one motor one direction.
12. Combine simple commands to make complex ones, like just moving in a specific direction. 
13. Determine worst-case current draw from your motors (**motor stall current**)


**Remember**

1. Never send voltage to both terminals at once.  

##Planning Process

**How to Power the MSP430**
1. The MSP430 can only accept 3.3v, whereas the source we have can only output 5v.  We need to use a regulator to drop this voltage.  Should maybe use a small capacitor across the 5V rail to smoth high frequency noise.  This capacitor should be ~0.1uF.  
2. To determine how this should be hooked up, this datasheet was consulted.  It deals with [voltage regulators](http://www.ece382.com/datasheets/LD1117V33.pdf).  This schematic is used below:

This was then attached to the MSP430 in the following way:

**Adding Large Coupling Capacitor**

Only the first will be added at this moment.  It will be ~100uF, as indicated in the directions, and will be placed across the 5v bus.  Of course the positive end must be placed in the 5v bus!!  No individual schematic is needed for this.  

**Adding the Driver**
The purpose of the driver allows the MSP430 to control the motors without burning up due to the current requirements.  The datasheet for the Quadruple Half Driver can be seen [here](http://www.ece382.com/datasheets/SN754410.pdf).  

Its pinout and function table may be seen below:

Next, to understand how to hook this up to the motors and to the MSP430, we must first decide how the program will run.  For simplicity sake, I plan on using two individual output signals for the forward direction, and a common output signal for the reverse.  This should make the design easier since we are not required to turn backwards. Therefore, hooking up the driver to the MSP430 and the motos should be relatively easy.  

First, we note that V_cc1 must be between 4.5 and 5.5 volts, as seen in the datasheet.  Therefore, V_ccs1 must be hooked up to the 5v source, which is the only source within range available on the robot.
