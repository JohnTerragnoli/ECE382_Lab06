============

#Purpose


#Prelab
**Things to accomplish**
1. How to use hardware to achieve robot control
2. Which pins will output which signals you need
3. Which side of the motor will you attach these signals to
4. How to use these signals to achieve forward/back/left/right movement
5. consider how you will setup the PWM subsystem to achieve control
6. what are the registers you'll need to use
7. which bits in the registers are important?
8. what's the initialization sequence you'll need?
9. Consider additional hardware you'll need (regulator, motor driver chip, decoupling capacitor)
10. How will you connect these extra parts?
11. Try to build simple commands, such as moving one motor one direction.
12. Combine simple commands to make complex ones, like just moving in a specific direction. 
13. Determine worst-case current draw from your motors (**motor stall current**)


**Remember**
1. Never send voltage to both terminals at once.
